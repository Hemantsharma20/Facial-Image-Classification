# Image Data Scrapping:

## Method 1: Using Selenium Script

You can use the python script `image_download.py` to scrap the data from the Google Images. The script uses latest version of Chromium driver which can be download from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). The script uses Selenium to open the browser and search for the images. The script will download the images in the `/dataset/images` folder.

## Method 2: Using Fatkun Batch Download

You can use the [Fatkun Batch Download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/nnjjahlikiabnchcpehcpkdeckfgnohf?hl=en) extension to download the images. The extension can batch download images from any website.
